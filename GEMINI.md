## Project Overview
**Project Name:** Youtube-AI-Agent-Agency
**Author/Owner:** VetEngineer
**License:** MIT

This project appears to be the foundational repository for an AI Agent Agency system, likely focused on YouTube automation, analysis, or content creation (inferred from the directory name).

## Current Status
As of the latest analysis, the repository is in an **initialization phase**.
- It contains a `LICENSE` file.
- It does not yet contain source code, configuration files, or detailed documentation.

## Development Conventions (Proposed)
Since specific conventions are not yet established in code, the following are recommended for this type of project:
- **Language:** Likely Python (for AI/ML capabilities) or TypeScript/Node.js (for web/api interactions).
- **Documentation:** Maintain `README.md` for general info and this `GEMINI.md` for AI context.
- **Version Control:** Standard Git flow.

## Goal
The primary goal for the AI assistant in this context is to assist in scaffolding the project, choosing the technology stack, and implementing the core logic for the AI Agent Agency.
